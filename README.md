# sonify
code for the sonify project

We are starting to codify the types of sonification techniques that are available in an ongoing attempt to create a catalog of sonification techniques. 

**Data as gestalt** 
- the direct sounding of the data. Individual data “packets” or icons of sound shaped by the scaled time series data

**Data as environment**
- the factory - the forest - electroacoustic space

**Data as presence** 
- the combination of sound possibilities driven by interaction and navigation

**Data as harmonic movement**
- Sequentially constructing music out of multi dimensional data

**Data as gesture** 
- a sea of sequences that are experienced as a sound field

**Data as music** 
- most common realization (for example: bar chart as melody)

**Data as extrinsic parameter change**
Extrinsic *Exformation* - freq., pitch, tone, reverb, delay or any other auditory parameter

**Data as location**
- representative sound material displaced by location and reverb

**Data as anomaly** 
- enigmatic sonic configurations that make the familiar, unfamiliar
